# Hi! I'm Anders. #

<p>
    I'm currently a senior at Lehigh University studying Industrial & Systems Engineering and Finance with minors in Data Science, Economics, and Computer Science. Originally from central Ohio, I love learning new things, working with others, playing and listening to music, and keeping myself busy doing things I find interesting - some of these projects you can find below! I'll begin working at Ernst & Young and a Technology Consultant for Financial Services companies in early 2023. Until then, I'm finishing up my studies and working on a few side projects! You can find more information on my professional background on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anders-seline/">LinkedIn</a>.
